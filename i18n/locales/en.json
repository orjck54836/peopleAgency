      "q1": "What role do you play in the overall process?",
      "a1": "We act as a matching and coordination partner, connecting Southeast Asian sending organizations, Taiwan-based human resources, and licensed Japanese employment agencies. Our role focuses on early-stage candidate information整理, condition alignment, and partner matching. We do not conduct employment placement or statutory procedures in Japan.",
  
      "q2": "Do you replace the role of Japanese employment agencies?",
      "a2": "No. We do not conduct employment placement activities in Japan. All formal job placement, employment contracts, and residence status procedures are handled exclusively by licensed Japanese employment agencies.",
  
      "q3": "What types of partners are suitable for cooperation?",
      "a3": "Our services are suitable for Japanese employment agencies that already handle or plan to handle overseas workforce cases, as well as partners seeking to expand their options for Southeast Asian or Taiwanese talent.",
  
      "q4": "Can cooperation start with a single case?",
      "a4": "Yes. Most collaborations begin with a single case or a backup staffing need. No exclusive or long-term commitment is required.",
  
      "q5": "Is it necessary to sign a long-term or exclusive agreement?",
      "a5": "No. Cooperation is conducted on a case-by-case basis to maintain flexibility and avoid interference with existing partnerships.",
  
      "q6": "Is cooperation still possible if we already work with a fixed Southeast Asian sending organization?",
      "a6": "Yes. We often act as a secondary or backup option, supporting cases that existing sending organizations may find difficult to handle or are temporarily unable to supply.",
  
      "q7": "Do you directly contact Japanese corporate clients?",
      "a7": "This depends on the cooperation model. When cases are led by a Japanese employment agency, we participate as a backend support and coordination partner without affecting existing client relationships.",
  
      "q8": "Who communicates with which parties during cooperation?",
      "a8": "We primarily coordinate with Southeast Asian sending organizations and Taiwan-side partners. Communication with Japanese companies and formal placement processes remains led by the Japanese employment agency.",

      "q2": "Are there additional introduction fees for Southeast Asian talent?",
      "a2": "The Southeast Asian sending organizations we cooperate with are long-term partners of Taiwanese enterprises. Therefore, no additional introduction fees are charged to the Japanese side.",
  
      "q3": "Are you limited to specific industries or job categories?",
      "a3": "No. However, suitability for overseas talent is evaluated during the early-stage assessment based on actual job content, working conditions, and management structure.",
  
      "q4": "Can you act as a secondary or backup talent source?",
      "a4": "Yes. We frequently serve as a backup option alongside existing sending organizations, particularly for cases with special conditions or higher risk.",
  
      "q5": "Is it possible to compare multiple nationalities or sources simultaneously?",
      "a5": "Yes. We can provide recommendations across multiple talent sources based on case conditions to support comparison and decision-making.",
  
      "q6": "Can you support situations where talent supply is unstable?",
      "a6": "One of our roles is to fill supply gaps by offering alternative options when existing channels cannot provide candidates in time.",
  
      "q7": "Do you help evaluate whether a position is suitable for overseas talent?",
      "a7": "Yes. Before entering the formal placement process, we can conduct an early-stage feasibility assessment of the position.",
  
      "q8": "Do you handle short-term or part-time-only cases?",
      "a8": "Our focus is on full-time positions eligible for lawful residence status. We do not handle cases limited to part-time work or short-term internships."

      "a1": "If communication or adaptation issues arise after placement, we can coordinate with sending organizations and relevant parties to provide informational support and adjustment assistance. However, we do not assume statutory management responsibilities in Japan.",
  
      "q2": "Do you handle labor management or labor disputes?",
      "a2": "No. Labor management and legal responsibilities are handled in accordance with Japanese law by the employer and licensed employment agency.",

      "q7": "Do you provide any employment outcome guarantees?",
      "a7": "No. We do not provide employment outcome guarantees. Our responsibility is limited to matching and coordination support.",
  
      "q8": "Can you help establish long-term cooperation processes?",
      "a8": "Yes. Based on cooperation experience, we can assist in organizing repeatable workflows and communication frameworks."
